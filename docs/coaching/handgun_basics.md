## Handgun Anatomy

### Major Components

#### Frame
- **Definition**: The main body of the handgun that houses the internal mechanisms
- **Materials**: Steel, aluminum, polymer, or composite materials

- **Definition**: The upper portion that moves during firing
- **Function**: 
  - Houses the barrel
  - Contains the firing mechanism
  - Ejects spent casings
  - Loads new rounds
- **Operation**: Moves rearward during recoil, forward during cycling

#### Cylinder (Revolver)
- **Definition**: Rotating chamber that holds ammunition
- **Capacity**: Typically 5-8 rounds
- **Operation**: Rotates to align chambers with barrel
- **Types**: Single-action, double-action

#### Trigger
- **Definition**: The lever that releases the hammer or striker

## Safety Fundamentals

### The Four Rules
1. **Always treat every firearm as if it is loaded**
2. **Never point the muzzle at anything you don't intend to shoot**
3. **Keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot**
4. **Be sure of your target and what is beyond it**

### Additional Safety Practices
- **Transport safely**: Use proper cases and holsters
- **Store securely**: Locked container, separate from ammunition
- **Maintain awareness**: Know your surroundings
- **Follow range rules**: Always obey safety protocols

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Manual safety**: Prevents accidental discharge
- **Trigger safety**: Internal safety device
- **Firing pin block**: Prevents firing pin movement
- **Magazine disconnect**: Prevents firing without magazine

## Shooting Fundamentals

### Stance
**Isosceles Stance**:
- Feet shoulder-width apart
- Knees slightly bent
- Arms extended equally
- Body square to target

**Weaver Stance**:
- Feet staggered
- Support foot forward
- Strong-side foot back
- Body bladed to target

**Modified Weaver**:
- Combines elements of both
- More natural position
- Better recoil control
- Improved accuracy

### Grip
**Proper Grip Technique**:
1. **Strong hand**: High on backstrap
2. **Support hand**: Fills gaps
3. **Thumbs forward**: Along frame
4. **Firm pressure**: Consistent grip
5. **Natural point**: Aligns with target

**Common Grip Mistakes**:
- Too loose or too tight
- Thumbs crossed
- Weak hand too low
- Inconsistent pressure

### Sight Alignment
**Proper Sight Picture**:
1. **Front sight focus**: Sharp and clear
2. **Rear sight**: Slightly blurry
3. **Target**: Very blurry
4. **Equal light**: On both sides
5. **Level alignment**: Top of sights

**Sight Types**:
- **Three-dot**: Most common
- **Bar-dot**: Competition style
- **Fiber optic**: Enhanced visibility
- **Night sights**: Low-light use

### Trigger Control
**Proper Technique**:
1. **Finger placement**: First pad on trigger
2. **Smooth press**: No jerking or slapping
3. **Straight back**: No side pressure
4. **Follow through**: Maintain pressure
5. **Reset**: Allow trigger to reset

**Common Mistakes**:
- Jerking the trigger
- Anticipating recoil
- Moving during press
- Releasing too quickly

### Breathing
**Breathing Technique**:
1. **Natural rhythm**: Don't hold breath
2. **Respiratory pause**: Natural pause in breathing
