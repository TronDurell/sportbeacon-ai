## The Four Rules of Gun Safety

### 1. Always Treat Every Firearm as if it is Loaded
- **Never assume a firearm is unloaded**
- Check the chamber and magazine well every time you handle a firearm
- Keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot
- Always verify the firearm is unloaded before cleaning, storing, or handing to another person

### 2. Never Point the Muzzle at Anything You Don't Intend to Shoot
- **Muzzle control is paramount**
- Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction
- Be aware of what is beyond your target
- Never point a firearm at another person, even in jest
- Consider the bullet's trajectory and potential ricochet

### 3. Keep Your Finger Off the Trigger Until Ready to Shoot

- Keep your finger outside the trigger guard until ready to fire
- Rest your finger along the frame or receiver
- Only place your finger on the trigger when sights are on target and you're ready to shoot
- Practice this habit consistently

### 4. Be Sure of Your Target and What is Beyond It
- **Target identification is critical**
- Positively identify your target before shooting
