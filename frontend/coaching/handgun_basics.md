### Types of Handguns

#### Semi-Automatic Pistols
- **Self-loading** after each shot
- Uses recoil or gas operation
- Magazine-fed ammunition
- Popular for self-defense and sport

#### Revolvers
- **Cylinder-based** design
- Multiple chambers for ammunition
- Simple and reliable operation
- Good for beginners

#### Single-Action vs Double-Action
- **Single-Action**: Hammer must be cocked manually
- **Double-Action**: Trigger cocks and releases hammer
- **DAO**: Double-Action Only
- **SA/DA**: Single-Action/Double-Action combination

## Caliber and Ammunition

### Common Calibers

#### .22 Long Rifle (.22 LR)
- **Low recoil** and noise
- **Inexpensive** to shoot
- **Good for** beginners
- **Limited** stopping power

#### 9mm Parabellum
- **Most popular** handgun caliber
- **Good balance** of power and capacity
- **Widely available** ammunition
- **Moderate recoil**

#### .45 ACP
- **Large, slow** bullet
- **High stopping** power
- **More recoil** than 9mm
- **Lower capacity** magazines

#### .38 Special
- **Revolver** cartridge
- **Moderate power** and recoil
- **Good for** self-defense
- **Reliable** performance

### Ammunition Components

#### Bullet
- **Projectile** that leaves the barrel
- Various types and weights
- **FMJ**: Full Metal Jacket
- **JHP**: Jacketed Hollow Point

#### Case
- **Brass container** for components
- Holds powder and primer
- **Reloadable** or disposable
- **Caliber-specific** sizing

#### Powder
- **Propellant** that creates gas
- **Burns** to create pressure
- **Consistent** burn rate
- **Proper** charge weight

#### Primer
- **Ignites** the powder
- **Impact-sensitive** compound
- **Located** in case base
- **Reliable** ignition system

## Operation and Function

### Loading and Unloading

#### Loading a Semi-Automatic
1. **Insert magazine** into well
2. **Pull slide** back and release
3. **Chamber** first round
4. **Engage safety** if applicable

#### Loading a Revolver
1. **Open cylinder** (swing out or break action)
2. **Insert rounds** into chambers
3. **Close cylinder** securely
4. **Check alignment** of cylinder

#### Unloading Safely
1. **Remove magazine** (semi-auto)
2. **Clear chamber** completely
3. **Verify empty** condition
4. **Engage safety** mechanisms

### Firing Sequence

#### Semi-Automatic Cycle
1. **Trigger pull** releases hammer
2. **Firing pin** strikes primer
3. **Cartridge fires** and bullet exits
4. **Slide recoils** and ejects case
5. **Slide returns** and loads next round

#### Revolver Operation
1. **Trigger pull** rotates cylinder
2. **Hammer falls** on primer
3. **Cartridge fires** and bullet exits
4. **Cylinder rotates** to next chamber
5. **Ready for** next shot

### Sights and Aiming

#### Sight Types
- **Fixed sights**: Non-adjustable
- **Adjustable sights**: Windage and elevation
- **Night sights**: Glow in darkness
- **Optical sights**: Red dot or scope

#### Sight Picture
- **Front sight** centered in rear notch
- **Top of sights** level
- **Equal light** on both sides
- **Focus on** front sight

#### Aiming Techniques
- **Two-handed grip** for stability
- **Proper stance** for balance
- **Smooth trigger** press
- **Follow through** after shot

## Maintenance and Care

### Cleaning Process

#### Disassembly
1. **Ensure firearm** is unloaded
2. **Follow manual** instructions
3. **Remove slide** and barrel
4. **Separate components** carefully

#### Cleaning Steps
1. **Apply solvent** to dirty areas
2. **Scrub with** appropriate brush
3. **Remove carbon** and fouling
4. **Clean barrel** thoroughly

#### Lubrication
1. **Apply light** oil to moving parts
2. **Avoid over-lubrication**
3. **Use quality** gun oil
4. **Wipe excess** oil away

#### Reassembly
1. **Follow reverse** order of disassembly
2. **Ensure proper** fit of parts
3. **Function test** after assembly
4. **Verify safety** operation

### Storage

#### Safe Storage
